Introduction

FastGEO is a library that contains a wide range of highly optimized
computational geometry algorithms and routines for many different
types of geometrical operations such as geometrical primitives and
predicates, hull construction, triangulation, clipping, rotations and
projections.

FastGEO offers a concise, predictable, highly deterministic interface
for geometric primitives and complex geometric routines using the
Object Pascal language.
